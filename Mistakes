1. I provided money, and cards for Metal and Power, but not for Manual Labor.  
The intent was that Manual Labor could only be done by getting a producer together directly with a consumer, and could not be intermediated.
This did not work well - I was not sufficiently clear about this, and players did in fact trade it back and forth as if it were Power, just with inconvenience from the lack of a card for it.
I should have either supplied cards for it (that disappeared at the end of the round like Power), or made it very clear that it could not be traded and needed direct contact.

2. I supplied a fairly large amount of starting money to several people, to ensure that there was sufficient liquidity.
I think I overdid this.  Time-value of money seemed low, and even the very extremely bad use of money I included (spend $240 now to get $260 later) got used.
In my defense, this failure mode was survivable and did not ruin the game, while a lack of liquidity could have ruined it.
Still, I should have tried to include more ways to spend money up-front for long-term advantage, to provide a greater value to money.
This would also have let the players who started with lots of money but not much else have a better time - they had less to do than I had anticipated thanks to a high supply of money.

3. There is a thing that was not allowed by the rules but that I receieved two separate questions about, and that I suspect several players may have done inadvertently.
If one player can turn $40 into a Metal and one can turn a Metal into $50, they can use these two abilities in combination to make a $10 profit...ONLY IF THEY START WITH EITHER $40 OR A METAL.
They cannot use these two abilities with no seed money to go from $0 to $10.
I should have made this clearer up front.
