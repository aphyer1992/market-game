1. I distributed cards, money, and a small amount of starting Metal manually among envelopes, ending up with 35 envelopes.  
I did not track exactly which cards were together, but the game should be relatively robust to that changing.

2. I gave most players 4 cards.  A few got 3 and usually a bit more starting money, and a few got weirder packets that I thought would be funny.

3. I tried to ensure a few things:

3a. All players should end up with something to do.  I made sure that every player received at least one card that I expected to be useful (except, again, for a couple odd players who got e.g. a lot of starting money and nothing else).

3b. No player's correct strategy should be autarchy.  I tried to ensure that if a player had e.g. an efficient Metal-consuming card, they did not also have an efficient metal-producing card.
Some players I deliberately tried to trick in this way (e.g. by giving them a card that consumed metal for $60 and a card that produced metal for $50.)  
Attempted autarchy would make this player $10, but they could make more than that by buying metal and not using their inefficient production card.

4. I gave out a bit more starting money than maybe was correct, in an attempt to ensure that the game did not grind to a halt for lack of liquidity, but tried to avoid providing so much as to make early money meaningless.
Most players with reasonably good cardsets started with limited money ($5-$25).  A few with worse or fewer starting cards began with more ($50-$100).

5. A few players got card allocations that were deliberate jokes by me.  The one I considered funniest was:

Medical Bills (pay $20 per round or die)
Debt (pay $10 per round or go bankrupt)
Manual Labor
Rich Old Grandpa (at the start of Round 3, gain $150)
